# Personal Reflection - Python Testing

This assignment taught me the importance of looking at every function individually. It also taught me how to use automated testing to verify that the project is working correctly and prevent bugs in the future. In order to be successful on this assignment, I had to think with more of an engineering/developing hat than just a coding hat.

Here is my test result:

``` python test_calculator.py
0\module5> python test_calculator.py   
.                        
------                                                        Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK 
```

If I had to break it down in my own words, my test returned successful validation of my function's behavior. It ran 1 test case, which was successful as indicated by the period output first by the 'python test_calculator.py' command. Since the expected output was returned for the tested input, the test returned 'OK'. The test would have displayed a failure message explaining
